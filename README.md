#### Don't write boilerplate ever again - make some pico instead!

## Features

- Modular and customizable
- and more coming soon!

## Overview

Picodegallo is a templating tool that removes the need for you to write boilerplate ever again. By leveraging custom
configuration files, called **recipes** you can use the command line to create them for you instead. Extend your recipes
with **ingredients** to make them modular and adapt to your requirements!

## Quick Start

The quickest way to get started with _picodegallo_ is to use [@picodegallo/cli](packages/cli/README.md). In your project
run:

```shell
yarn add --dev @picodegallo/cli
```
